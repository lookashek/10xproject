## Project Description

10x Cards enables learners to quickly create and manage study flashcards. By leveraging large language models (via **OpenRouter.ai**) the application can instantly propose questionâ€“answer pairs from any text you provide, drastically reducing the time required to create high-quality study materials.

Key features:

- Paste up to **10 000 characters** of text and generate flashcard suggestions in one click.
- Accept, edit or reject AI-generated cards before saving them.
- Manually create, edit and delete your own flashcards.
- Basic user authentication backed by **Supabase** (sign-up, log-in, account deletion).
- Study sessions powered by a spaced-repetition algorithm.
