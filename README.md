## Project Description

10x Cards enables learners to quickly create and manage study flashcards. By leveraging large language models (via **OpenRouter.ai**) the application can instantly propose questionâ€“answer pairs from any text you provide, drastically reducing the time required to create high-quality study materials.

Key features:

- Paste up to **10 000 characters** of text and generate flashcard suggestions in one click.
- Accept, edit or reject AI-generated cards before saving them.
- Manually create, edit and delete your own flashcards.
- Basic user authentication backed by **Supabase** (sign-up, log-in, account deletion).
- Study sessions powered by a spaced-repetition algorithm.

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Vitest + Testing Library)

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (recommended during development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

Unit tests are located in `__tests__` directories next to the tested files:
- `src/components/ui/__tests__/` - UI component tests
- `src/lib/__tests__/` - Utility function tests
- `src/lib/algorithms/__tests__/` - Algorithm tests (e.g., SM2)
- `src/lib/validation/__tests__/` - Zod schema validation tests

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npm run e2e:install

# Run E2E tests
npm run e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
npm run e2e:ui

# Generate new E2E tests interactively
npm run e2e:codegen

# View HTML report after test run
npm run e2e:report
```

E2E tests are located in the `e2e/` directory:
- `e2e/pages/` - Page Object Models
- `e2e/*.spec.ts` - Test specifications

## Project Scope

### In scope (MVP)

- AI-assisted flashcard generation & manual editing
- CRUD operations for user-owned flashcards
